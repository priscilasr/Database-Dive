Database Dive

This project gave me experience creating a software system that handles data hosted in the cloud and provides a customized user experience for two different groups of users.  Users want to make informed decisions based on large amounts of data, but often have no way to store, organize, and understand the data to make these decisions.  This is where a solution was created to help with this problem.
